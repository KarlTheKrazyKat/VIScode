# viscode README

This is an extension to be used alongside the VIS python module available via github. Its aim is to make the creation of tkinter elements and screens even easier and faster than using the VIS module alone. Some planned features will require that the user has the VIS module installed as well and may only be available once a .VIS project has been initialized.
